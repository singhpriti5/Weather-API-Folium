# Python-Weather-with-Folium


I've tried my best to make this code easy to understand, so that even a beginner can understand it easily 

GET CITY AND WEATHER DATA WITH MAP USING REST-API AND FOLIUM

to get api key you need to visit https://openweathermap.org/api

 * Sign-up
 * Current Weather Data -> subscribe -> Free -> Get API key
put the api key here

``` py
API_KEY= "PUT YOU API KEY HERE" 
```

Example if you API key is **"WSAD64566546WSAD64566546"**
put it like this
``` py
API_KEY= "WSAD64566546WSAD64566546" 
```
